summary = "One aim of the project is to find new ways to capture and represent something meaningful about an individual and their relationships through a combination of physical things and digital media (which could mean photographs, music, film clips etc). We hope to better understand the potential benefits that design and digital technologies can bring to people to offer new ways to: (i) Express a sense of who they are in the present, but also for the future; (ii) Make objects and media content that will support other people after oneâ€™s death; (iii) Enable people, who are already bereaved, to maintain lasting bonds in new ways with someone who has now died."
