title: "SILVER: Smart Interventions for Local Vulnerable Families"
summary: "One of Connected Health Cities’ major areas of interest in the North East and North Cumbria is the high risk user groups and vulnerable families. For example, children subject to a Child Protection Plan, adults and young people out of work/at risk of worklessness or at risk of financial exclusion, and families affected by a range of social and health problems such as anti-social behaviour, domestic violence and substance use.   The SILVER programme aims to explore how data linkages can be implemented to benefit these same populations.

The SILVER project aims to link data across multiple agencies including health (physical and mental), social care, criminal justice, housing and education in order to develop a more complete Learning Health System."
