title: "Design and initial evaluation of an autism-specific health check for use with autistic adults in NHS Primary Care"
summary: "Autistic people are more likely to experience poor health than people who are not autistic. Some don't seek help when they are unwell and many find going to the doctors difficult. We will work with autistic people to develop and test an autism health check for use in General Practice (by GPs). It could become something that in the future is offered to all autistic people on the NHS."
