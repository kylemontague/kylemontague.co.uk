I'm an Associate Professor at Northumbria University and lead the [NorSC Research Group](https://nor.sc "Northumbria Social Computing Research Group") . My research spans a breadth of topics and domains with the unifying vision - **to address critical social problems and challenges by designing and configuring digital technologies that empower individuals and marginalised communities.** More specifically, my work seeks to democratise access to the tools and processes by which we provision technologies and services that shape society.
