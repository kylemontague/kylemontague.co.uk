abstract = "This article details the development of a live design research project working with people who are bereaved, people are living with dementia and people who are approaching end of life. The project aims to support people to continue bonds with others in anticipation of and following death. It centres on the idea of ongoingness and using art, design and digital technologies in gentle, personally meaningful ways."
