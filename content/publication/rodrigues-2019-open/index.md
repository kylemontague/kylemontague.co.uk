abstract: Blind people face significant challenges when using smartphones. The focus
  on improving non-visual mobile accessibility has been at the level of touchscreen
  access. Our research investigates the challenges faced by blind people in their
  everyday usage of mobile phones. In this paper, we present a set of studies performed
  with the target population, novices and experts, using a variety of methods, targeted
  at identifying and verifying challenges; and coping mechanisms. Through a multiple
  methods approach we identify and validate challenges locally with a diverse set
  of user expertise and devices, and at scale through the analyses of the largest
  Android and iOS dedicate forums for blind people. We contribute with a prioritized
  corpus of smartphone challenges for blind people, and a discussion on a set of directions
  for future research that tackle the open and often overlooked challenges.
