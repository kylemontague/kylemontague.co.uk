abstract: "In the proposed thesis, research examines possible exploitations of shared user modelling in order to improve the accuracy and scope of models used for personalisation within touch screen mobile devices to improve the accessibility and usability of software applications. Previous work in adaptive user interfaces has relied on local and domain specific user models, which lack in scope and detail. Shared user models can increase the accuracy and depth of data used to adapt the interfaces and user interactions."
