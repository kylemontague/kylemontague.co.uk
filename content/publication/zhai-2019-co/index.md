abstract: "Sleep deprivation is a growing public health issue which has a range of implications on a personâ€™s working routine. Yet despite the effects of sleep deprivation, workplace-based wellness programs do not have any awareness of sleep deprivation. Our study adopted a three-stage design process with nine participants from a local manufacturing company to highlight awareness of sleep deprivation. Our study contributes design considerations for the implementation of workplace-based wellness programs that raise awareness of the importance of sleep quality as how employees can share their personal sleep data within the workplace."
