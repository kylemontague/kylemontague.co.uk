abstract: "In this paper we present a possible approach to improve accessibility and usability of software applications through shared user models. Previous work in adaptive user interfaces has relied on local and domain specific user models, which lack in scope and detail. Shared user models can increase the accuracy and depth of data used to adapt the interfaces and user interactions. This research focuses on the accessibility of touch screen mobile devices for users with low vision and mobility impairments."
