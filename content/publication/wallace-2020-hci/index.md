abstract: "Death, whilst an inevitable part of being alive, factors more significantly in our lives than the event itself. The role that technology can play in how people live as they approach end of life as well as in bereavement is full of rich possibilities, but research here is also fraught with ethical and methodological dilemmas. Although there has been a turn to focus on the topic of death by some in HCI we need to go far further to embrace the contexts relating to it more meaningfully and broadly. Through this design focused workshop, we will bring experts and interested parties together to creatively explore opportunities and challenges for HCI at the end of life and beyond. Discussions and design activities will be supported by conceptual resources for design, lived experience accounts, design methods and ethical resources. The workshop will provide a time and place to bring together experts but will also provide an open and accepting environment for those for whom HCI at end of life and beyond is a new area of concern."
