abstract: "This paper explores evidence for the conjecture that improvements in Web accessibility have arisen, in part, as side effects of changes in Web technology and associated shifts in the way Web pages are designed and coded. Drawing on an earlier study of Web accessibility trends over the past 14 years, it discusses several possible indirect contributors to improving accessibility including the use of new browser capabilities to create more sophisticated page layouts, a growing concern with improved page rank in search results, and a shift toward cross-device content design. Understanding these examples may inspire the creation of additional technologies with incidental accessibility benefits."
