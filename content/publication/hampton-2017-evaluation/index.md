abstract: "Patients are increasingly bringing their own mobile phone photos to clinic to help in the diagnosis and management of their skin conditions. We noticed that they often struggle to find the images from their camera roll and that the quality and consistency was often poor. To solve these problems we have built an app for skin self-monitoring. MySkinSelfie (www.myskinselfie.com) is a free app available on both app stores. Users can create folders, dated and with attached comments. All images are encrypted and stored on cloud servers with no data on the phone."
