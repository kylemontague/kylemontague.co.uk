abstract: "This research focuses on designing an indoor navigation application for disabled users. Outdoor navigation systems make use of GPS satellites to locate users; this same technique, however, is not reliable enough for indoor way-finding. Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) exist but rely on complex and expensive networks. Described here is a new approach towards such indoor navigation, reporting on research related to the interactions and user experiences involved in locating a user within a building. Interactions are customized to suit the needs of individual users when way-finding helping to ensure that the tool is both usable and accessible by users of varying abilities."
