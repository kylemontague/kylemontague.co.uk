abstract: "Teledermatology generally involves doctors taking images of patients; however, patients increasingly want to own or have easy access to their health data. MySkinSelfie ( http://myskinselfie.com) is a mobile phone application (app) designed to improve the quality, consistency and accessibility of patient-held photos, and was developed to give patients the ability to generate and hold their own skin images to help guide their skin care. This study assessed the usability of this app in a cohort of patients attending a National Health Service Dermatology clinic. Patients were asked to use the app but were not given specific tasks to achieve. Of the 102 patients recruited, 32 downloaded the app and registered an account, 21 took at least one photo (median 5, range 1-103) and 19 completed the usability questionnaire. The majority of questionnaire respondents found the app easy to use but were more neutral on whether it really helped them to manage their skin problem. MySkinSelfie has been shown to be easy to use. Self-monitoring of skin problems may be useful for a subset of patients, and this is likely to depend on diagnosis, age and other patient factors."
